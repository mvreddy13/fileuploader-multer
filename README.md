# fileuploader-multer
This Express-based Node.js application handles file uploads with the help of the multer middleware. The app allows users to upload images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP) while ensuring that the file size does not exceed 5MB. It also handles basic error handling and stores the uploaded files in a directory called uploads.
